Battlefield Server Info

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ The Battlefield Server Info project is a simple web app that fetches and displays real-time information about a Battlefield server. The data includes the server's name, game mode, current map, player count, ping, and tickrate. I built this using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend to make the server data dynamic and easily accessible.

The idea is to give players and server admins a quick look at the server's stats without needing to join it.

Features
Live Server Info: Shows real-time data like server name, game mode, map, players, ping, and tickrate.
Dynamic Updates: Fetches the server data using Axios from a Node.js backend and updates the frontend dynamically.
Responsive Design: The UI adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes so you can check server stats on any device.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Axios for fetching data
Backend: Node.js with Express
Styling: You can use Styled Components or just plain old CSS, whatever suits your style!
Other: npm, Webpack (for bundling).
